# 1 An abstract look at problem solving

## Practice breaking it down! Explain as if the listener has never done it before: what are the steps involved in tying a shoelace?

1. Preparation - check that laces are properly laced in the shoe
2. Beginning knot - first knot to set up the shoe lace
3. Rabbit ears - turn the laces into rabbit ears in each hand
4. Final knot - tie the second knot with the rabbit ears
5. Tighten - tighten the laces to make sure they're safe on your feet


## In our “Say Hi” example, if the Say Hi part of the program never runs, how would you narrow down the problem? What would the roadmap for narrowing down the Say Hi problem look like?

If the program never runs, I would work backwards. "Say Hi" would be the first stage I look at, and if it is broken, I'd make my way up the chain to "User button click", and if that is broken, to "User name input".


## Create a problem-solving example using a roadmap and the process of elimination for narrowing down issues of your own. You already use this skill daily. Break down and explain a problem you solve in your everyday life.

Problem: 
Lost my keys.

Roadmap: 
Left the house -> Door closed behind me (does not need key to lock) -> Put keys in backpack pocket -> Walked to the MUNI -> Got on the tram -> Got off at train stop -> Walked to work -> At work with bag on ground untouched -> Picked up back and headed to the train station -> Got on the MUNI -> Got off the tram -> Walked home -> Looked for keys to open door 

Where I would work back:
I would work back through my day on places where (1) I touched my keys, and (2) Where my bag would have been open and my keys could have dropped out. 

The main moments when my keys would have been touched would be (1) at home, or (2) taking the keys with me as I left home. My bag would have been touched (1) on public transit, (2) bounced while walking, or (3) touched at work.
